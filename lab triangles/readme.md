# Orbitals/attraction/ecosystem

While it's not complete, the program is designed to depict a triangle getting attracted to a circle. When the triangle collides with the circle, the circle will move, and the triangle will move to the new location of the circle. I'm still stuck on this, and i'm currently seeking assistance.

## Future plans

I plan to eventually evolve this program into an ecosystem, which will have predators (triangles), and prey (circle).

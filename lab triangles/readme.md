# Orbitals/attraction/ecosystem

This program depicts a triangle getting attracted to a circle. When the triangle gets close to the circle, the circle will move, and the triangle will move to the new location of the circle.

## Future plans

I plan to eventually evolve this program into an ecosystem, which will have predators (triangles), and prey (circle).

# Orbitals/attraction/ecosystem

This program depicts a triangle getting attracted to a circle. When the triangle gets close to the circle, the circle will move, and the triangle will move to the new location of the circle.

## Future plans

I plan to eventually evolve this program into an ecosystem, which will have predators (triangles), and prey (circle).

## Current update

Getting stuff to render, will render a bunch of lines that follow each other. Current plan is to use angle and create some offset to render the snake and it's segments. Need to determine how to give the x and y or angle to the next item in the array. (stopped here for the night since it was approaching midnight.)

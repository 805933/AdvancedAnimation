# Snake Lab

This lab depicts a snake created with vector objects. The snake has several segments, with each part dependent on another. The segments of the snake are within an array

The snake will be drawn with a line and line caps.

## Current update

Getting stuff to render, will render a bunch of lines that follow each other. Current plan is to use angle and create some offset to render the snake and it's segments. Need to determine how to give the x and y or angle to the next item in the array. (stopped here for the night since it was approaching midnight.)
